# Counter
###A Simple Counter 

##Purpose

To practice building **functions** in JS along with renenforcing basic fundimentals. 
I wanted to build this project using both **.querySelector()** and the **.addEventListener()** methods
instead of the simpler *.getElementById* and *onclick*.

I had create a 'master' branch due to coming across the "src refspec master does not match any" Error.
I'm not sure what I did wrong on the inital push to the repo, but I am choosing to leave it in hopes I learn something from it. 

Here's to making mistakes!
